# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions:

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: git is a form of communication used within Github to work on items as an individual or group.

Researched answer: Git is used for version control in whcih a label marker is created/attached to each new change to a project.
Github is a platform in which users store and share projects in which people can access.

2. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: An array's index is the location in which an item is sitting within the array. The value of an array is like the item within the array.
i.e- const myArray = ["lions", "tigers", "bears", "oh" "my"]
console.log(myArray[1]) would pull "tigers" because indexs start at 0 and 0 = "lions"
value of an array: "lions" "tigers" etc.

Researched answer: Array index- sequential numbers that are like an address for every element in the array.
Array value- an JavaScript data type.

3. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Similiar: They are a set of data/datatypes. 
Different: Strings are represented with quotes "" where arrays are represented by brackets []. Methods and functions used while using arrays and strings. Ex: .toUpperCase can be used directly within a string where as, in a array you must complete a few steps before using the .toUpperCase method. -> .slice("") -> .toUpperCase -> .join("")

Researched answer: Similar: Arrays and Strings are both a collections of items that are a property lenght and indexes that start at 0. 
Difference: An array can hold any data type whereas a string is an object that store multiple characters in a single value.

4. STRETCH: What are the four pillars of object oriented programming?

Researched answer: ---Pulled from freecodecamp.org/GeeksforGeeks.org---
The four pillars of object oriented programming are: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.
- Abstract programming- is hiding away the details in which a function is ran.
- Encapsulation- The proccess in which you expose only the neccessary information to the public and hide the private details.
- Inheritance- When one object has the properties and methods for another object.
- Polymorphism- When a function has different identities that can be used for militple instances

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. Higher Order Functions: A method built into javascript that turns a function into an arguement. 

2. Jest: A framework within JavaScript that is compiled of multiple collections of files that contain snipped of code functionality.

3. Objects: A data type used within JavaScript that holds a collection of things.
